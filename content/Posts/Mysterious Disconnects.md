title: Mysterious Disconnects
---
As I'm sure you're aware, we've had a wave of mysterious disconnects from the server recently. After a very long time researching and looking into this, I have found nothing that could consistently cause the problem. So, I've been logging any errors you report in a spreadsheet to try and diagnose the problem.

My goal was to log enough data entries to see some form of trend while collecting the following data:
- Date and time
- Error Message 
- Player Affected 
- Player's Country 
- Number of Players Online
- Number of Players Affected
- In Game Event That Coincided with Disconnect

So. With all this, what did I find? Not much tbh. So I started tracking if ZFS issues could be to blame. And got *some* results.
