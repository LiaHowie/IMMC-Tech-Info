Hello! Welcome to IMMC's tech info site. I'm Lia, the owner of IMMC. This is just a place for me to ramble about the more technical side of the server, with comments enabled on every post for any suggestions or opinions 😃

The github for this Quartz static site is also public, if anyone is at all interested! https://github.com/LiaHowie/IMMC-Tech-Info
